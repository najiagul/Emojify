# Emojify

This is the first assignment from the second week of 'Sequence Models' which is the last course of deeplearning.ai specialization.

Emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing:

"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:

"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
